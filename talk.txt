Welcome! Lost, are we?
Did you accidentally click that link?
Don’t worry, this isn’t an AI-generated page.
Nope, definitely not AI here.
You can check out talk.txt in the Git repo.
Oh, you missed the Git link above? No biggie.
It’s fine; there was another link for the portfolio, too.
Yes, the cat is repetitive, just like these texts.
Instead of reading this, you could be doing something productive.
All this sarcasm? Inspired by The Stanley Parable.
Don’t know it? Didn’t think so.
Look at you, finding your way to my site.
Oh, another visitor. How unique.
Congratulations on stumbling across my site. Truly impressive.
Oh, you’re still here? Someone must really love sarcasm.
Feel free to stay as long as you like. I’ll pretend I’m thrilled.
I’m so glad you’re here, said no one ever.
Another page visit? I’m on a roll!
Welcome to my site. Don’t expect too much.
If you’re looking for groundbreaking content, you might want to keep looking.
Oh, you clicked again. How adventurous of you.
Just in case you forgot, I’m still not AI.
You’ve made it this far. I applaud your dedication.
If you’re wondering about my portfolio, it’s somewhere around here—probably.
Thanks for visiting. I’m here all week, unfortunately.
Keep scrolling. It’s not like you have anything better to do.
I’m delighted to have another visitor. No, really, I am.
Did you think this site was going to be revolutionary? Spoiler: it’s not.
Another click? You must really be bored.
Yes, the cat is here again. It’s like déjà vu but with more fur.
